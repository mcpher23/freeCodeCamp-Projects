# freeCodeCamp-Projects
In this repository you will find my freeCodeCamp Projects that accompany the courses source material. These files contain the actual code to perform the task assigned as well as either a test case with the expected output or a series of files named main.py and test_module.py that when run will perform freeCodeCamps automated tests.
